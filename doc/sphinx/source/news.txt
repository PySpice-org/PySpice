V1.3.0 (development release)
----------------------------

V1.2.0 (production release) 2018-02-xx
--------------------------------------

 * Initial support of the |Xyce|_ simulator.  Xyce is an open source, SPICE-compatible,
   high-performance analog circuit simulator, capable of solving extremely large circuit problems
   developed at Sandia National Laboratories.  Xyce will make PySpice suitable for industry and
   research use.
 * Fixed OSX support
 * Splitted G device
 * Implemented partially `A` XSPICE device
 * Implemented missing transmission line devices
 * Implemented high level current sources
   **Notice: Some classes were renamed !**
 * Implemented node kwarg e.g. :code:`circuit.Q(1, base=1, collector=2, emitter=3, model='npn')`
 * Implemented raw spice pass through (see `User FAQ </faq.html>`_)
 * Implemented access to internal parameters (cf. :code:`save @device[parameter]`)
 * Implemented check for missing ground node
 * Implemented a way to disable an element and clone netlist
 * Improved SPICE parser
 * Improved unit support:

   * Implemented unit prefix cast `U_μV(U_mV(1))` to easily convert values
   * Added `U_mV`, ... shortcuts
   * Added Numpy array support to unit, see `UnitValues` **Notice: this new feature could be buggy !!!**
   * Rebased `WaveForm` to `UnitValues`

 * Fixed node order so as to not confuse users **Now PySpice matches SPICE order for two ports elements !**
 * Fixed device shortcuts in `Netlist` class
 * Fixed model kwarg for BJT **Notice: it must be passed exclusively as kwarg !**
 * Fixed subcircuit nesting
 * Outsourced documentation generator to |Pyterate|_
 * Updated `setup.py` for wheel

V1.1.0 2017-09-06
-----------------

 * Enhanced shared mode
 * Shared mode is now set as default on Linux

V1.0.0 2017-09-06
-----------------

 * Bump version to v1.0.0 since it just works!
 * Support Windows platform using Ngspice shared mode
 * Fixed shared mode
 * Fixed and completed Spice parser : tested on example's libraries

V0.4.2
------

 * Fixed Spice parser for lower case device prefix.

V0.4.0 2017-07-31
-----------------

 * Git repository cleanup: filtered generated doc and useless files so as to shrink the repository size.
 * Improved documentation generator: Implemented :code:`format` for RST content and Tikz figure.
 * Improved unit support: It implements now the International System of Units.
   And we can now use unit helper like :code:`u_mV` or compute the value of :code:`1.2@u_kΩ / 2@u_mA`.
   The relevant documentation is on this `page <api/PySpice/Unit.html>`_.
 * Added the Simulation instance to the Analysis class.
 * Refactored simulation parameters as classes.

V0.3.2 2017-02-22
-----------------

 * fixed CCCS and CCVS

V0.3.1 2017-02-22
-----------------

 * fixed ngspice shared

V0.3.0 2015-12-08
-----------------

 * Added an example to show how to use the NgSpice Shared Simulation Mode.
 * Completed the Spice netlist parser and added examples, we could now use a schematic editor
   to define the circuit.  The program *cir2py* translates a circuit file to Python.
